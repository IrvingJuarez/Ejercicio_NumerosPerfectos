            <h3>Perfect numbers</h3>
            <p>The goal is the development of an algorithm which should be able to return the perfect numbers lower than <i>n</i></p>
            <p>Great, but... what's a perfect number? It is a number which is equal to the addition of its dividing numbers, without considering itself as a dividing one. For instance, the number 6 is a perfect number because it is divisible by: 1, 2 and 3. The sum of all these 3 numbers returns 6 as result. UÃ¡la, we got the first perfect number</p>
            <p>Now, the user needs to insert the range through which the algorithm will search for perfect numbers and the output will be all the perfects numbers lower than the inserted one</p>
